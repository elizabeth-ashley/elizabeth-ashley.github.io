      As an advocate for <strong>science communication</strong>, I enjoy bridging the gap between <strong>science and design</strong> &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful science. My goal is to always create easily understood visual science that is informative
      and engaging with pixel-perfect user experiences. I want to empower young people from all walks of life to pursue STEM, explore the outdoors
      and recognize how art can be a useful tool for communicating science.

      As a Graduate Student, I spend my time studying the impact human activities such as wastewater
      injection wells, geothermal energy production, mining and explosions have on inducing earthquakes.
      I use seismic data and satellite imagery to provide evidence of these impacts.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably studying rocks, climbing rocks, and painting rocks!
